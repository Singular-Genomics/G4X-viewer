## Explore and visualize G4X-data  
---

G4X-viewer is an advanced, open source project designed to visualize imaging data using modern web technologies. The project is continuously evolving to provide an intuitive and flexible interface for the analysis and presentation of complex datasets. Inspired by the [Viv](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/viv) library, our goal is to push the boundaries of interactive data visualization in web applications.

The G4X-viewer enables you to visualize and interact with your [G4X data](https://docs.singulargenomics.com/g4x_data/g4x_output/) in a user-friendly interface. With it, you can begin to understand spatial patterning of your tissues, take screenshots of specific features of interest, subsample your data, and gain insights into your specific biological system.

We provide a web-based version of the G4X-viewer that can be accessed through our [website](https://g4x-viewer.singulargenomics.com). For users who want to use it locally, we also provide installation instructions on our [Github](https://github.com/Singular-Genomics/G4X-viewer).

!!! tip
    Older data sets may require use of our [legacy viewer](https://g4x-viewer.legacy.singulargenomics.com) if the data was generated before December 2025. In this legacy viewer, many analysis features will be unavailable. For a full list, see the [features](./features.md) page.

### usage

Please navigate to the [usage](./usage.md) page to see descriptions of the core files that are compatible with the G4x-viewer and how to load them into the viewer to start exploring your data. 

<br>

### features

Please navigate to the G4X-viewer [features](./features.md) to list out some of the core functionality of the viewer using the multimodal, multilayered images. 

These features include:
+ visual adjustments (contrast, marker colors, tx density)
+ ROI selection (polygons, multi-select, import/export tx and cell IDs)
+ simple plot generation (heatmaps, cell type composition)
+ basic filtering (protein intensity, tx identity)

<br>

### resources

Please navigate to the G4X-viewer [resources](./resources.md) to help you leverage the suite of tools available in the G4X-viewer
