## About

G4x Viewer is an advanced open source project designed to visualize imaging data using modern web technologies. The project is continuously evolving to provide an intuitive and flexible interface for the analysis and presentation of complex datasets. Inspired by the [Viv](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/viv) library, our goal is to push the boundaries of interactive data visualization in web applications.

## Technologies

G4x Viewer is built using:

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** – A library for building user interfaces
- **[Material-UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/)** – A collection of ready-to-use UI components
- **[DeckGL](https://deck.gl/)** – A framework for large-scale data visualization
- **[Viv](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/viv)** – A tool for visualizing image data

For a complete list of dependencies, please refer to the `package.json` file.

## Demo

Below is a preview of the application:
