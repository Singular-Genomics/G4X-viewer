Inspired by the Viv library, our goal is to push the boundaries of interactive data visualization in web applications.</p> <p>The G4X-viewer enables you to visualize and interact with your G4X data in a user-friendly interface. With it, you can begin to understand spatial patterning of your tissues, take screenshots of specific features of interest, subsample your data, and gain insights into your specific biological system.</p> <p>We provide a web-based version of the G4X-viewer that can be accessed through our website. For users who want to use it locally, we also provide installation instructions on our Github.</p>"},{"location":"#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<p>Please navigate to the G4X-viewer resources to help you leverage the suite of tools available in the G4X-viewer</p> <p> \u2e3b  </p>"},{"location":"DEVELOPMENT/","title":"Development Guide","text":"<p>Quick reference for developers working on G4X Viewer -
